# Chromium traces and CDP

Read this when Chrome, Edge or another Chromium browser is the target and you need a performance trace, DevTools insights, runtime counters, CPU or network throttling, or a CPU profile. Playwright talks to Chromium over the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), the same channel the DevTools panel and chrome-devtools-mcp use, so none of this needs a DevTools MCP server. Use the shared rendering, loading and resource guidance for acceptance criteria; this reference supplies the Chromium measurement path.

## Setup

Launch through `launchPlacedChrome()` (`scripts/lib/launch-chrome.mjs`): headed Chrome on the real GPU, placed out of the operator's way, one browser per script, so parallel subagents each get their own. It needs `playwright` or `playwright-core`. DevTools insights also need `@paulirish/trace_engine`, the trace engine from the DevTools Performance panel published to npm.

This workflow grants no permission to install tools. If a package is missing, ask; with approval, `npm i --no-save playwright-core @paulirish/trace_engine` keeps them out of `package.json`. In an unattended run without them, record insights as not measured and work from raw trace events or the CDP calls below.

Preflight each method with one real capture and inspect its output before relying on it.

## Capture a trace

```js
import { launchPlacedChrome } from '../scripts/lib/launch-chrome.mjs'; // path from a script in .tmp/

// the categories the DevTools Performance panel records; insights need the disabled-by-default ones
const CATEGORIES = [
  '-*', 'devtools.timeline', 'disabled-by-default-devtools.timeline',
  'disabled-by-default-devtools.timeline.frame', 'disabled-by-default-devtools.timeline.stack',
  'v8.execute', 'disabled-by-default-v8.cpu_profiler', 'blink.user_timing', 'blink.resource',
  'loading', 'latencyInfo', 'toplevel', 'disabled-by-default-lighthouse',
  'disabled-by-default-devtools.timeline.invalidationTracking', 'disabled-by-default-layout_shift.debug',
];

const browser = await launchPlacedChrome({ purpose: 'perf trace' });
const context = await browser.newContext({ viewport: { width: 1400, height: 900 } });
const page = await context.newPage();
const cdp = await context.newCDPSession(page);
await page.goto('about:blank');
await cdp.send('Performance.enable'); // counters start here, so enable before the scenario
await browser.startTracing(page, { path: tracePath, categories: CATEGORIES, screenshots: false });
await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'load' }); // or drive the interaction being measured
await page.waitForTimeout(4000);
await browser.stopTracing();
```

Start tracing before the navigation when you want load insights. A 4-second trace of a three.js example page came to about 24 MB, so write traces to the project's artifact location outside the repository and never commit them. Tracing adds overhead: traces locate causes, and acceptance timings come from matched, minimally instrumented runs.

## Read DevTools insights

```js
import { analyzeTrace } from '@paulirish/trace_engine/analyze-trace.mjs';

const { parsedTrace } = await analyzeTrace(tracePath);
for (const [navId, set] of parsedTrace.insights) {
  for (const [name, insight] of Object.entries(set.model)) {
    console.log(navId, name, insight.state, insight.metricSavings);
  }
  // an insight that throws is left out of set.model and lands here instead
  for (const [name, err] of Object.entries(set.modelErrors ?? {})) {
    console.log(navId, name, 'not computed:', err.message);
  }
}
```

Report anything in `modelErrors` as not measured. A missing insight is not a pass.

The insight names match the DevTools Performance panel: `LCPBreakdown`, `LCPDiscovery`, `RenderBlocking`, `NetworkDependencyTree`, `CLSCulprits`, `INPBreakdown`, `DocumentLatency`, `Cache`, `ImageDelivery`, `FontDisplay`, `ThirdParties`, `DOMSize`, `ForcedReflow`, `DuplicatedJavaScript`, `LegacyJavaScript`, `ModernHTTP`, `SlowCSSSelector`, `Viewport` and `CharacterSet`. Each has a `state` (`pass`, `fail` or `informative`), `metricSavings`, and its own detail fields, for example `RenderBlocking.renderBlockingRequests` and `Cache.requests` with a `ttl` per request. `LCPBreakdown` gives `lcpMs` plus `subparts` such as `ttfb` and `renderDelay`, each with a `range` in microseconds.

Each navigation gets its own insight set. The period before the first navigation, or the whole trace when there is none, gets a `NO_NAVIGATION` set, which the engine drops when it is shorter than 5 seconds, every insight passes, and it has no LCP, interaction or layout shift. A 3-second trace of steady animation on a loaded page was dropped this way and returned zero insight sets. To get insights such as `INPBreakdown` and `ForcedReflow` without a navigation, perform the real input during the trace or record for at least 5 seconds. Frame and long-task data below does not depend on insight sets.

## Frames, long tasks and user timing

These come from `parsedTrace.data` and work with or without a navigation.

- **Frames:** `parsedTrace.data.Frames.frames`, each with `duration` in microseconds plus `dropped` and `isPartial` flags. A main-thread stall shows up as a run of dropped frames at normal duration, not as one long frame: a 120 ms block on a 100 Hz display produced 11 dropped 10 ms frames and a maximum frame duration of 10.1 ms. Count dropped frames alongside duration percentiles, or the stall disappears.
- **Long tasks:** `[...parsedTrace.data.Renderer.entryToNode.keys()]`, filtered to `name === 'RunTask'` with `dur > 50_000` (microseconds). `Renderer.allTraceEntries` was empty in the tested engine version.
- **User timing:** `parsedTrace.data.UserTimings.performanceMeasures` lists the app's `performance.measure()` spans; add sparse marks around app phases to line the trace up with the journey.
- Other handlers include `NetworkRequests`, `LayoutShifts`, `Memory`, `GPU`, `Samples`, `Screenshots`, `Workers`, `AnimationFrames` and `Invalidations`.

The engine package mirrors DevTools internals and its field names can move between versions (0.0.66 was tested). Print the keys of an object before depending on a path.

## Counters, throttling and CPU profiles

Send these through the `cdp` session from the capture snippet.

- **Counters:** `Performance.getMetrics` returns `JSHeapUsedSize`, `Nodes`, `LayoutCount`, `RecalcStyleCount`, `ScriptDuration`, `TaskDuration` and more. Durations are in seconds and accumulate from `Performance.enable`. Enabling it after the load makes the load's work read as zero.
- **CPU throttling:** `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate({ rate: 6 })` slows the renderer's main thread only, not the GPU. Verify it with a fixed JavaScript loop timed before and after (37 ms became 245 ms at 6x); rAF frame rate on a light or GPU-bound scene can stay unchanged, as it did at 100 fps. Set the rate back to 1 afterwards.
- **Network throttling:** call `Network.enable`, then `Network.setCacheDisabled({ cacheDisabled: true })` for a cold HTTP cache, then `Network.emulateNetworkConditions({ offline: false, latency, downloadThroughput, uploadThroughput })` with throughput in bytes per second. Record the exact values: a 150 ms, 1.6 Mbps profile took one page load from 2.8 s to 5.1 s. Use a fresh context per cold run, and note that this clears only the HTTP cache.
- **CPU profile:** `Profiler.enable`, `Profiler.start`, then `Profiler.stop` returns a profile you can save as `.cpuprofile` and open in DevTools. To name the top contributors, sum `timeDeltas` per sampled node's `callFrame` and sort by self time.

## When chrome-devtools-mcp is available

It reads the same CDP data and runs the same DevTools trace engine, so it adds convenience, not measurements. The path above keeps headed real-GPU Chrome, window placement and one browser per subagent. Use the MCP only if it is already enabled and the project's one-browser rule allows it.
